        <h1>Gender Bias in AI</h1>
  <section>
    <p>
        When conducting online searches, biases in AI algorithms often become apparent. For instance,
        a search for "greatest leaders of all time" predominantly displays male figures, reflecting societal
        stereotypes. UNESCO emphasizes the importance of avoiding gender bias in AI to ensure fair
        and accurate representation, as outlined in the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of
        Artificial Intelligence.

    <h1>AI in the Court of Law</h1>
  <section>
    <p>
        The growing use of AI in judicial systems sparks ethical questions about transparency,
        neutrality, and the protection of human rights. While AI has the potential to enhance efficiency,
        concerns about bias, lack of transparency, and privacy issues arise. The UNESCO
        Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence addresses these challenges and
        advocates for a balanced approach to the use of AI in the legal realm.

    <h1>AI in Artistic Creation</h1>
  <section>
    <p>
        AI's role in generating art introduces unique ethical considerations. Instances like a
        computer-generated Rembrandt painting and an AI-completed symphony by Huawei challenge
        traditional notions of authorship and copyright. UNESCO recognizes the need for new
        frameworks to distinguish between human and AI contributions in the creative process,
        safeguarding artists' rights and ensuring fair compensation
