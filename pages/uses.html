  <h1>The Uses of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
  <h3>How AI is used worldwide and taking into account the following factors</h3>

  <div class="wrapper">
    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        Recognizing cultural influences on reasoning is crucial for AI systems in conflict resolution and decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
        To align AI with our values, we need systems that consider cultural nuances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examining moral decision-making reveals that cultural standards significantly impact views on acceptable actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Computational models, like MoralDM, incorporate culturally specific stories for more accurate and transparent reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
        This innovative approach, utilizing cultural narratives for data, ensures better alignment with diverse cultures and positive impacts.

    <h2>Economy</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        Widespread AI adoption reshapes global economies, raising concerns about inequalities
        between AI-empowered and lagging sectors. Dominance by a few nations in advanced AI
        capabilities could solidify their global economic dominance, escalating a race for superior
        autonomous weaponry. The evolving economic model, driven by digital technologies,
        challenges traditional manufacturing and fossil fuel dependence.
    </p>
    <p>
        AI's impact on the workforce raises concerns about job displacement and introduces a
        paradigm shift in the cyber world. The profound global impact of AI demands ongoing
        research, with a foreseeable future concentrating power and resources. Navigating this era
        requires multilateral institutions to play a pivotal role in steering the AI-driven trajectory,
        ensuring alignment with ethical and governance principles.

    <h2>Politics</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        The integration of AI in political campaigns, exemplified by the Republican National Committee's 
        AI-generated ad during the 2023 elections, raises concerns. Experts highlight issues like 
        misinformation driven by social media, deep fakes, and the need for vigilance in combatting AI misuse 
        in shaping public opinion. Vulnerable populations, especially women of color candidates, face 
        disproportionate targeting in online mis- and disinformation campaigns. The concept of the "liars 
        dividend" warns of deep fakes eroding public trust in political messaging. Social media platforms 
        grapple with regulating AI-generated content, leading to legislative responses like the "REAL 
        Political Advertisements Act." Discussions on AI regulation recognize the urgency to address 
        potential threats in the political realm, emphasizing responsible and ethical AI deployment 
        in the political landscape.
